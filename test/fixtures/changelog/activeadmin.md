# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Security Fixes

* Prevent leaking hashed passwords via user CSV export and adds a config option for sensitive attributes. [#5486] by [@chrp]

### Removals

* Rails 4.2 support has been dropped. [#5104] by [@javierjulio] and [@deivid-rodriguez]
* Dependency on coffee-rails has been removed. [#5081] by [@javierjulio]
  If your application uses coffescript but was relying on ActiveAdmin to provide
  the dependency, you need to add the `coffee-script` gem to your `Gemfile` to
  restore it. If your only usage of coffescript was the
  `active_admin.js.coffee` generated by ActiveAdmin's generator, you can also
  convert that file to plain JS (`//= require active_admin/base` if you
  didn't add any stuff to it).
